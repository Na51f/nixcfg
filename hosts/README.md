## Hapalo (Gaming PC)
- Named after the blue-ringed octopus (hapalochlaena) due to colorful RGB and deadly performance
- Runs NixOS and dual boots with Windows for games that do not support Linux.

## Loligo (Laptop)
- Named after the common squid (loligo vulgaris) since this is a run-of-the-mill but portable machine as common squids are pretty small.
- Will most likely only run NixOS.

## Sepia (Mac Mini M4)
- Named after the common cuttlefish since Macs are more creative machines and sepia is also the name of the ink cuttlefishes produce, which is widely used by artists.
- Will only run macOS.
